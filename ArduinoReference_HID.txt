HID library

  This core library allows a 32u4 based board, a Due and a Zero to become an HID device, 
making it possible to plug on it a Mouse or a Keyboard or whatever HID device comes to your mind. 
The library itself is not intended to be used directly but act as a layer between the USB core and any library implementing HID functions.

  The HID library implements a PluggableUSBModule so the porting to another architecture is straightforward after porting PluggableUSB.

  The only function publicly available is HID.SendReport(uint8_t id, const void* data, int len) which is used to 
report data to the attached PC (through functions like Mouse.move() )

  NicoHood's HID library implements a lot of HID devices and plugs on base HID
